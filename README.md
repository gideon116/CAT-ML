# **Machine Learning Models for Computer Aided Transformations**
CAT is an organic synthesis planning software. It gives users the optimal synthetic routes to convert a compound of their choice into a desirable product. With the help of CAT, users can convert unwanted compounds to useful ones. This repository contains different machine learning models that CAT can use.
